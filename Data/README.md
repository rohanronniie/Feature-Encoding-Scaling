Raw and preprocessed dataset files

## Note on Preprocessed Dataset

The complete preprocessed dataset is generated programmatically within the notebook.
Due to GitHub file size limitations, the full scaled CSV is not included in this repository.

To reproduce the dataset, run:
Adult_Income_Encoding_Scaling.ipynb

A small sample file (`adult_income_preprocessed_sample.csv`) is provided for reference.
